## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Usage

1. Select your preferred programming language from the dropdown menu
2. Write your code in the editor panel
3. Add any required input in the input field (if your program reads from stdin)
4. Click the "Run" button to execute your code

EXECUTION_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=10000
```

## Security Considerations

This application implements several security measures:
- Code execution is performed in a sandboxed environment
- Resource limits are enforced to prevent abuse
- Input validation is performed to prevent injection attacks
